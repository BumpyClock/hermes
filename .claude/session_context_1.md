# Session Context 1

## Task: Repository Rename and Update

**Previous Task**: ✅ COMPLETED - Create Developer Documentation
**Current Task**: ✅ COMPLETED - Repository Rename from parser-go to hermes

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Project**: Hermes - High-performance web content extraction library (Go implementation)

**Context**: Hermes is a Go implementation of a web content parser inspired by Postlight Parser, focusing on extracting clean, structured data from web pages with 150+ custom extractors and high-performance features.

## Recent Updates (Repository Rename & Go Module Publication):

### Repository Rename Completed ✅
- **Git Remote**: Updated from `https://github.com/BumpyClock/parser-go.git` to `https://github.com/BumpyClock/hermes.git`
- **Benchmark References**: Updated all references in benchmark scripts and documentation
- **Configuration Files**: Updated .golangci.yml local-prefixes and Makefile docker tags
- **Package Names**: Updated benchmark package.json name from parser-comparison-temp to hermes-benchmark
- **File References**: Updated all directory and project name references throughout benchmark files

### Go Module Publication Completed ✅
- **Module Path**: `github.com/BumpyClock/hermes` properly configured
- **Release Tag**: Created and pushed `v1.0.0` with comprehensive release notes
- **Go Proxy**: Module indexed and available via `proxy.golang.org`
- **Verification**: Successfully tested downloading via `go get github.com/BumpyClock/hermes@v1.0.0`
- **Documentation**: Updated README with proper installation instructions for Go module, CLI tool, and source build
- **Public Availability**: Module is now live and accessible to the Go community

## Completed Work:

### 1. Project Analysis ✅
- Analyzed complete project structure across `pkg/`, `cmd/`, `internal/`, and `tools/`
- Examined Go modules and dependencies including goquery, html-to-markdown, go-dateparser
- Studied core parser implementation in `pkg/parser/parser.go` and types
- Reviewed custom extractors (150+ site-specific parsers) and generic extraction algorithms
- Analyzed content cleaners, resource layer, and utility functions

### 2. Documentation Structure Created ✅
