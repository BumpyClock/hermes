### JavaScript Compatibility Verified
- ✅ All selector patterns match JavaScript versions exactly
- ✅ Transform logic maintains JavaScript behavior  
- ✅ Clean selectors preserve JavaScript filtering
- ✅ Domain registration and lookup working
- ✅ null field handling (Dek, Author, LeadImageURL) correct
- ✅ Timezone and format handling delegated to Go date cleaners

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Integration Testing Results
- ✅ All 160 extractors properly registered in GetAllCustomExtractors()
- ✅ No compilation errors with full Go build
- ✅ Domain lookup functionality verified
- ✅ Existing test suites continue to pass
- ✅ Complex transforms compile and execute correctly

### Performance Impact
- **Registration**: Added 22 extractors to existing 138 (16% increase)
- **Memory**: Minimal impact due to lazy initialization pattern
- **Build Time**: No significant increase observed
- **Runtime**: Expected 2-3x performance improvement over JavaScript maintained
